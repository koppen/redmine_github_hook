= Redmine Github Hook

This plugin allows you to update your local Git repositories in Redmine when changes have been pushed to Github.

== Description

Redmine <http://redmine.org> has supported Git repositories for a long time, allowing you to browse your code and view your changesets directly in Redmine. For this purpose, Redmine relies on local clones of the Git repositories.

If your shared repository is on a remote machine - for example on Github - this unfortunately means a bit of legwork to keep the local, Redmine-accessible repository up-to-date. The common approach is to set up a cronjob that pulls in any changes with regular intervals and updates Redmine with them.

That approach works perfectly fine, but is a bit heavy-handed and cumbersome. The Redmine Github Hook plugin allows Github to notify your Redmine installation when changes have been pushed to a repository, triggering an update of your local repository and Redmine data only when it is actually necessary.


== Installation

1. Installing the plugin
   1. Install the json gem <http://json.rubyforge.org/> on the machine where Redmine is running.
   2. Follow the plugin installation procedure at http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins.
   3. Restart your Redmine.
   4. If you already have a local Git repository set up and working from Redmine go to step 3, otherwise continue at step 2.

2. Adding a Git repository to a project (note, this should work whether you want to use Redmine Github Hook or not). Simplyfollow the instructions at http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/HowTo_keep_in_sync_your_git_repository_for_redmine

3. Connecting Github to Redmine
   1. Go to the repository Admin interface on Github.
   2. Under "Service Hooks" add a new "WebHook URL" of the format: "[redmine_installation_url]/github_hook" (for example "http://example.com/github_hook").
      1. By default, Github Hook assumes your Github repository name is the same as the project identifier in your Redmine installation. If this is not the case, you can specify the actual Redmine project identifier in the Post-Receive URL by using the format "[redmine_installation_url]/github_hook?project_id=[identifier]" (for example "http://example.com/github_hook?project_id=my_project").

That's it. Github will now send a HTTP POST to the Redmine Github Hook plugin whenever changes are pushed to Github. The plugin then takes care of pulling the changes to the local repository and updating the Redmine database with them.


== Assumptions

* Redmine 2 running on a *nix-like system. Redmine versions before 2.0 should use the redmine_1.x branch.
* Git 1.5 or higher available on the commandline.
